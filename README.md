## Project Objective:
- Develop a secure, convenient, and user-friendly web-based platform for music-band rental services available to consumers.
- Connect customers and musicians directly to rent music related services.
- Transform the manual process of renting a band/musician to an online, computerized, and 24x7 available system.

## Project Scope:
UnitedTune is an online rental web application aimed at taking band/musician rental services to customers' fingertips. The web application acts as an open platform where customers and musicians can come together, musicians can advertise their services, and customers can select services based on their interests. The web application does not offer any other event management services; it only provides band/musician rental services to make their event more memorable.  

In the initial stage, the application will provide services to small regions and will expand further in the long run. The web application modules will include customers and musicians registration, booking system,  payment operations, reservation processing, rating and feedback, and the administration panel for overall management. The application will provide a high level of security and integrity of the system's data and will always be available for access. The GUI of the web application will design in such a way that it will be easy to understand for end-users. 

Overall, UnitedTune is a platform that will motivate musicians to offer their services to customers. Customers will be able to see these services and their availability and make reservations from the web application with just a few clicks.
